The Manifold Dashboard forwards a user to this route during single
sign-on to a resource's dashboard.

A `code` and `resource_id` are sent as query parameters allowing the
provider to request an access token.

The `code` is scoped to the initiating user and resource being accessed
and is only valid for five minutes. It cannot be used more than once.

Once an access token has been acquired for this user's session by
the provider's server, the user should be forwarded to the
resource's dashboard.

The provider should associate the access token with the user for
the duration of their session.

The access token is sensitive data that grants access to a user's
data within Manifold. It should be treated with care.

Requests to this route will *not* be signed by Manifold as they are
performed by the user's browser.

**IMPORTANT**: A malicious user *could* tamper with the `resource_id`
query parameter. To prevent this, the provider *must* validate that the
user has access to the targeted resource by requesting information
about it from the Connector API using the granted access token.
